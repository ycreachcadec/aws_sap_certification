# Cheat sheet 
- Lambda Alias supports canary deployments
- EFS allows cross region replication
- Aurora Global Database provides cross-region read replicas and failover capabilities
- RDS supports cross-region read replicas which can be promoted to master in case of a disaster. This can be done using Route 53, CloudWatch, and lambda functions
- Cloudformation stack policy can prevent stack resources from being unintentionally updated or deleted during a stack update. Stack Policy only applies for Stack updates and not stack deletion
- Amazon WorkSpaces provides a virtual workspace for varied worker types, especially hybrid and remote workers
- Amazon OpenSearch est le successeur du service ElasticSearch

- Amazon Pinpoint est un service de communication marketing flexible et évolutif qui vous connecte avec vos clients par e-mail, SMS, notifications push
- built-in time series analytics : utiliser TimeStreams
- You can use WorkSpaces to provision virtual desktops for users.
- AWS Step Functions can help coordinate a series of Lambda functions in a specific order. Multiple functions can be invoked sequentially, passing the output of one to the other, and/or in parallel, while the state is being maintained by Step Functions.
- Export logs from Cloudwatch to S3 can take up to 12hours
- GuardDuty can automatically respond to threats by taking actions such as blocking IP addresses, disabling IAM users, or sending notifications to you with the help of services like Lambda, Eventbridge, etc.
- Amazon Detective : investigation tools for security issues (ML based)
- Amazon GuardDuty : parse metrics & logs to detect security breach (ML based)
- Aurora scale de 64To à 128To (based on Engine)
- Amazon Outposts propose S3
- In an active-active configuration, requests made to an S3 Multi-Region Access Point’s global endpoint automatically route over the AWS global network to the nearest S3 bucket.
- RDS Cross-Region Read Replicas create an asynchronously replicated read-only DB instance in a secondary AWS Region.
- RDS cross region replications : A source DB instance can have cross-region read replicas in multiple AWS Regions.
- Blue/Green deployment is possible in RDS GUI
- AWS Kinesis Data Streams : synchronously replicates data across three AZs in an AWS Region
- Multiple Kinesis Data Streams applications can consume data from a stream, so that multiple actions, like archiving and processing, can take place concurrently and independently.
- Kinesis Data Streams s'intègre à KMS
- Kinesis Data Streams s'intègre aux VPC endpoints
- Kinesis Data Streams s'intègre à CloudTrail
- Kinesis Agent is a pre-built Java application that offers an easy way to collect and send data to the Kinesis stream.
- Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) : is an easy-to-use and highly configurable library that helps to put data into a Kinesis stream.
- Kinesis Client Library (KCL)is a pre-built library with multiple language support
- Kinesis Connector Library : is a pre-built library that helps you easily integrate Kinesis Streams with other AWS services and third-party tools. (deprecated by Firehose)
- AWS RAM permet de partager des outbounds resolver 
- Token Vending Machine = Cognito ( Cognito renvoi un token Cognito que le client utilise sur l'API STS pour récupérer ses credentials temporaires )
- AWS Simple : Pas de MFA, RDS SQL Server ou de AwS SSO
- Redshift est multi AZ
- 250 MB of storage max for lambda
- Lambda container (max 10Go of all uncompressed layers)
- Lambda 50mo via GUI for upload (use S3 up to 250mo) 
- SCP does not impact service linked roles
- SNI does not work for Classic load balancer ( work for ALB / NLB )
- AWS Step Functions : Standard Workflow state machine does not support multiple concurrent executions with the same name.
- CloudWatch Synthetics canaries are configurable scripts that run on a schedule, to monitor endpoints and APIs.
- Timestream can periodically and automatically schedule queries to perform real-time analytics on incoming data.
- AWS batch peut avoir des dépendances entres ces jobs 
- you can’t deploy an application to your on-premises servers using Elastic Beanstalk.
- AWS Systems Manager est très orienté AWS et on-prem
- The Route 53 health check has an overall lower request count compared to using the target group health check.
- Amazon EKS Anywhere is not designed to run in the AWS cloud. It does not integrate with the Kubernetes Cluster API Provider for AWS.
- Amazon ECS Anywhere isn’t designed to run on AWS Outposts
- Route53 has now a full integration of DNSSEC 
-  multicast domain is primarily used in delivering a single stream of data to multiple receiving computers simultaneously.
- CNAME record cannot be used for apex domain configuration in Amazon Route 53. 
- Alexa for Business != Amazon Lex (Alexa for Business est un facilitateur d'usage de Alexa dans un contexte Business)
- AWS Elemental MediaConnect is a high-quality transport service for live video.
- Amazon Polly is a machine learning service, it is quite limited as it just turns text into lifelike speech
-  Amazon Comprehend is used to derive and understand valuable insights from text within documents
- When you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting, you must give the bucket the same name as the record that you want to use to route traffic to the bucket. (No CloudFront scenario)
- SSM patch manager : You can install patches individually or to large groups of instances by using Amazon EC2 tags
- AWS VM Import/Export does not support synching incremental changes from the on-premises environment to AWS
- You cannot modify the trust policy of a service-linked role
- For billing purposes, the consolidated billing feature of AWS Organizations treats all the accounts in the organization as one account
